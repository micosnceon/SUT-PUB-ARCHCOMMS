# FOLIO

#### _After looking at the folio submissions here are some general comments, please find those that are applicable to you. This was discussed in WK10 Class - S_


## Amendments to Brief Requirements 
> Interactive PDF : **Do no submit videos within the pdf** - upload to Youtube or Instagram. Link to it from the pdf make sure to share a **PUBLIC link**. Include a few frames from the video on the folio. 
>

## WK09 Q/A 

1. **Imprint page** example (Inside Class Onedrive) 
2. **How many pages?**  Quality pages over quantity pages, but don't be afraid to have blank pages for visual rest. Looking for consistency more pages gives more chances for inconsistency.
3. **Why do we have to upload on Issu?** So that you start becoming aware of your public image.
4. **Issu page limit 50 page.** If you need more pages feel free to upload in two parts or an abridged version. 

-------
### Text Content - NO WAFFLE 

* The language should be **clear** and **concise**; do not use more words than necessary, do not use complicated words for the sake of it or convoluted / long sentences. 

### LEVEL OF DETAIL

* Focus on delivering information at different scales for through Heading > sub > heading > bold text > bulk of text. Don't make titles ambiguous, make them as detailed as possible.  

* ### Cassopea

* #### A myth of boastfulness

   * text text text **gets transported to the stars** text text text text text text **because she was boastful**

### REFLECTION

* Reflection on work is critical **use a different colour** and add a key at the start (readable / dark) to hi-light what you learnt and how you moved forward.
  * _This is what I learnt [-------] this is how I moved forward_

### IMAGE DUMPING

* Do not show the same thing from twenty different sides or dump large amounts of dirty sketches, pick a few and **reflect** on your process

### INSERTING POSTERS

* Do not insert the full poster into sections A or B, zoom in show some images, discuss some techniques, take a page to display a particularly beautiful drawing perhaps.

* Show the progressive improvements in section C, all in one place so it demonstrates iteration.

### REPEATED HEADINGS

* No need to write. "Experiment" over five pages over and over again. or "Introduction" over five  different pages. Write it as 1.Introduction and then subsequently put in inside the header, unobtrusively.

### ON IMAGES

* Use a clean backgrounds with no corners and no hands. 
* Level the camera - take the image orthogonally
* Post process images AND renders to make sure the are consistent with each other and to clear.
* Remember more images more referencing.....  

### SKETCHES

* Do not show pages and pages of sketches which have not been curated. Meaning, select some and arrange them nicely.

### CONTENT PAGES

* Follow the exact list from page 3/16 Folio V2 pdf (
 _Follow the contents page i.e (1) Cover Page (2) Imprint page..._). So it is easy for tutors to give you marks. Don't use week numbers etc... 
* This should be used to ensure all material is covered.

### PLEASE USE A GRID

* An underlying grid structure should be set up in your indesign file. It should be on every single page.
* Pages should have margins (at least 10mm).
* Pages should have header space
* Pages should have footer space
* Pages should have aligned text and images.

### WHITE SPACE IS GOOD

* Give your audience breathing room.
* Do put too much information in one page.
* PRINT out a spread to understand
* Fold an A4 and sketch little boxes so you understand.

### LOOK AROUND

* Look at the precedent images in the brief and study them closely.
* Look at a book nearby (to understand text / header / footer / page numbers)

### ON FONTS

* Keep them consistent.
* As a guide try 8pt Times New Roman (the font is just a guide for size) at A5 for the Approximate size / information density, with 10mm margins
* Do not use 'fancy' heading fonts - neat and consistent.

### UNDERLAYS

_meaning background images / motifs_

* NO.
* Solid Colours for a hi-light page is okay.
* No text on photos
